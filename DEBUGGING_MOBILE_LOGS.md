## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Firebase Issues**

### Common Error Messages and Solutions

#### 1. Network Issues
```
❌ Network connectivity check failed
📶 Network error - check internet connectivity
```
**Solution**: Check internet connection, try different network

#### 2. Timeout Issues
```
🐌 Request timed out - check network connection
```
**Solution**: Slow network, Firebase servers might be down

#### 3. Permission Issues
```
🔒 Permission denied - check Firestore security rules
```
**Solution**: Firestore security rules are too restrictive

#### 4. Configuration Issues
```
❌ Firebase initialization failed: [firebase_core/no-app]
```
**Solution**: Check `google-services.json` file placement
