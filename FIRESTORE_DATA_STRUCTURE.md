## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Firestore Database
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Firestore Database
4. Click "Create database"
5. Choose "Start in test mode" (for development)

### Step 2: Create Collections
Create these collections manually in Firestore:
- `news_articles`
- `matches`

### Step 3: Add Sample Data

#### Sample News Article:
```json
// Collection: news_articles
// Document ID: (auto-generated or custom)
{
  "title": "Lakers Win Championship",
  "summary": "LeBron leads Lakers to victory in Game 6",
  "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Miami Heat 106-93 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals...",
  "author": "Sports Reporter",
  "publishedAt": "2024-01-20T20:00:00Z",
  "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546519638-68e109498ffc?w=800",
  "category": "basketball",
  "source": "ESPN",
  // tags, readTime, and isBreaking fields removed per user request
  "views": 0
}
```

#### Sample Match:
```json
// Collection: matches
// Document ID: (auto-generated or custom)
{
  "homeTeam": "Los Angeles Lakers",
  "awayTeam": "Boston Celtics",
  "status": "upcoming",
  "date": "2024-01-25T20:00:00Z",
  "league": "NBA",
  "venue": "Crypto.com Arena"
}
```

## üìä Firestore Rules

For development, you can start with these basic rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read access to news articles
    match /news_articles/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false; // Prevent client writes for now
    }
    
    // Allow read access to matches
    match /matches/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false; // Prevent client writes for now
    }
  }
}
```

## üîç Querying Examples

The app will automatically query Firestore using these patterns:

```dart
// Get latest news articles
firestore.collection('news_articles')
  .orderBy('publishedAt', descending: true)
  .limit(50)
  .get()

// Get upcoming matches
firestore.collection('matches')
  .orderBy('date', descending: false)
  .limit(20)
  .get()

// Get specific article
firestore.collection('news_articles')
  .doc(articleId)
  .get()
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Indexing**: Firestore will automatically suggest indexes when needed
2. **Pagination**: Consider implementing pagination for large datasets
3. **Caching**: The app includes offline support via Firestore caching
4. **Search**: For better search functionality, consider integrating with Algolia

## üîÑ Migration from Mock Data

Your app will automatically:
1. Try to fetch from Firestore first
2. Fall back to mock data if Firestore is unavailable
3. Show loading states during data fetching
4. Handle errors gracefully

Once you add data to Firestore, the app will start using real data while maintaining the same UI and functionality.
